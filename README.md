# NATOPhoneOSX

A very simple and tiny OSX app to encode/decode [NATO alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet).

This was made as an exercise to learn Swift.

There's nothing fancy about it - quite the contrary, it's rather minimalist and the code is childish - but I thought it could maybe give hints to absolute beginners.
